### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year undergraduate @ The University of Georgia studying CogSci ðŸ§  + CS ðŸ’¾. Currently, I'm conducting research in the Department of Psychology as a member of the <a href="https://research.franklin.uga.edu/visual-perception-laboratory/" target="_blank">Visual Perception Laboratory</a> and creating a photographic body of work tentatively titled <a href="https://www.austinkral.com/persistence-of-vision#1" target="_blank"><em>Persistence of Vision</em></a> inspired by ecological psychology and biosemiotics.
